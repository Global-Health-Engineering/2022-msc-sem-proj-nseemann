  abstract = {Designing optimization models and meta-heuristic algorithms for minimization of traveling routes of vehicles in solid waste collection has been gaining interest in environmental modeling. The computer models and methods are useful to bring out specific strategies for prevention and precaution of possible disasters that could be foreseen worldwide. This paper proposes a new Spatial Geographic Information System (GIS)-based Genetic Algorithm for optimizing the route of solid waste collection. The proposed algorithm, called SGA, uses a modified version of the original Dijkstra algorithm in GIS to generate optimal solutions for vehicles. Then, a pool of solutions, which are optimal routes of all vehicles, is encoded in Genetic Algorithm. It is iteratively evolved to a better one and finally to the optimal solution. Experiments on the case study at Sfax city in Tunisia are performed to validate the performance of the proposal. It has been shown that the proposed method has better performance than the practical route and the original Dijkstra method.},

  abstract = {`Waste' is everywhere, a common aspect of daily life in both the West and the Global South. However, the ways in which we as individuals understand it as a problem is far from universal. It does not exist independently from the people it affects, rather, waste, as a problem, is continually made and remade through human practice. The purpose of this article is to explore how and why certain `waste' items are and become understood as problems. We adopt Foucault's (1984) notion of `problematisa-tion', as an analytical lens for conceptualising processes of problem formation through the eyes of two different groups working within and on the margins of Mzedi Dump Site in Blantyre, Malawi: subsistence maize growers and informal waste pickers. Drawing on extensive qualitative and ethnographic fieldwork, our findings suggests that for those working at Mzedi, waste problematisations are shaped by the tangible: the visible, and often painful impacts that Mzedi's hazards have on their lives and livelihoods. However, the ultimate problematisation of waste lies in its utility, i.e. `good' waste, is internalised based on its value. `Bad' trash however, is problematised because it has no value, and is therefore considered useless, a problem taking up time and space that could be utilised more profit-ably. Understanding these processes of problem formation, and the degree to which waste problematisations are personal and/or socially constructed, has important ramifications for the adoption of appropriate waste management strategies and should inform a more nuanced and inclusive waste management studies discourse.},

Recently, Informal Waste Pickers (IWPs) have been incorporated into waste management cooperatives by formalizing their operations as a strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of waste management in such areas. This study was conducted in Zingwangwa, an unplanned settlement in Blantyre, Malawi, to understand whether the formalization of IWPs into cooperatives could be effective and/or accepted as a way of managing Municipal Solid Waste in unplanned urban settlements in Malawi. Thirty-four IWPs in Zingwangwa were identified and interviewed using a structured questionnaire; personnel from the Blantyre City Council and middlemen were interviewed as key informants. We determined that IWPs experience challenges in all dimensions of their lives: low material prices with exploitative price fluctuations, negative public perception and a lack of transportation are a few of their struggles. Furthermore, a fear of decreased income, conflicts during proceeds sharing, free riding behaviors and an attachment to their independence mean that IWPs are unlikely to form a cooperative on their own though some would be willing to join if a third party initiated the formalization process.},

  abstract = {Background: Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) have been previously used to quantify the regularity in centre of pressure (COP) time-series in different experimental groups and/or conditions. ApEn and SampEn are very sensitive to their input parameters: m (subseries length), r (tolerance) and N (data length). Yet, the effects of changing those parameters have been scarcely investigated in the analysis of COP time-series. This study aimed to investigate the effects of changing parameters m, r and N on ApEn and SampEn values in COP timeseries, as well as the ability of these entropy measures to discriminate between groups. Methods: A public dataset of COP time-series was used. ApEn and SampEn were calculated for m = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, r = \{0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5\} and N = \{600, 1200\} (30 and 60 s, respectively). Subjects were stratified in young adults (age {$<$} 60, n = 85), and older adults (age {$\geq$} 60) with (n = 18) and without (n = 56) falls in the last year. The effects of changing parameters m, r and N on ApEn and SampEn were investigated with a three-way ANOVA. The ability of ApEn and SampEn to discriminate between groups was investigated with a mixed ANOVA (within-subject factors: m, r and N; between-subject factor: group). Specific combinations of m, r and N producing significant differences between groups were identified using the Tukey's honest significant difference procedure. Results: A significant three-way interaction between m, r and N confirmed the sensitivity of ApEn and SampEn to the input parameters. SampEn showed a higher consistency and ability to discriminate between groups than ApEn. Significant differences between groups were mostly observed in longer (N = 1200) COP time-series in the anterior-posterior direction. Those differences were observed for specific combinations of m and r, highlighting the importance of an adequate selection of input parameters. Conclusions: Future studies should favour SampEn over ApEn and longer time-series ({$\geq$} 60 s) over shorter ones (e.g. 30 s). The use of parameter combinations such as SampEn (m = \{4, 5\}, r = \{0.25, 0.3, 0.35\}) is recommended.},

Especially considering the high proportion of organic waste, composting is a promising opportunity to tackle the problem. However, composting has had low uptake due to competing fertilizer subsidies, the perceived labour required, and a lack of training and equipment. Considering these issues, this paper presents an analysis of the political dynamics around SWM at markets in Blantyre, Malawi, and to understand how these dynamics may potentially affect the sorting of organic waste in order to improve the production of compost. We find complex systems of both formal and informal management that are deeply linked to the official political structures, creating a diverse array of actors with various vested interests. Implementing a separation program would need community engagement and long-term financial viability to ensure that the project is not abandoned as others have been. This paper contributes to understanding how the complexity of urban governance, combined with party politics, can affect the potential for introducing new models of waste management. It emphasises the importance of understanding both informal and formal management structures before designing interventions.},

We estimated the willingness to pay (WTP) for two hypothetical solid waste collection services. Additionally, we tested the impact of the WTP question positioning relative to environmental perceptions on respondents' WTP. The first scenario involved a five minute walk to a disposal facility; the second scenario involved a 30 min walk. Additionally, the order of the question was randomized within the questionnaire. A WTP value of K1780 was found for the five minute walk scenario when the question was placed first, and K2138 when placed after revealing the respondent's perceptions on the environment. In the 30 min walk scenario, WTP was K945 when placed first and K1139 when placed after revealing the respondent's perceptions on the environment. The estimated values indicate that there is both a willingness to pay for solid waste services and that there are at least two options that would be acceptable to the community; a pilot scale implementation would be required to validate the hypothetical values, especially given the dependency on problem framing. Community financing should be considered as a sustainable approach to solid waste management in underserved areas.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop an intelligent solution to a complex, real-life vehicle routing problem in the waste management sector. Waste management companies deliver various types of empty waste containers to industrial customers, to be filled with different types of waste, after which the containers are picked up again. The full containers are transported to a so-called waste management depot or waste handling depot, where they are emptied, after which they are reused. Empty containers are stocked in various stock depots. Time windows in which containers may be picked up and delivered at the customers and opening hours of the different depots have to be taken into account additionally. Very importantly, there are two types of waste collection trucks that can, respectively, carry one or two containers. The resulting vehicle routing problem belongs to a class of so-called roll-on\textendash roll-off problems, characterized by unit demand. Additionally, the problem discussed in this paper has several characteristics (multiple waste types, multiple container types, multiple depots, a heterogeneous fleet, pickup and delivery, time window constraints, and other) that make solving it a difficult task. To solve this problem, we develop a novel column generation scheme that incorporates a heuristic approach to generate new columns. The master problem is solved by linear relaxation of a set partitioning problem. New routes (columns) are generated by a constructive heuristic loosely based on Solomon's insertion heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The construction heuristic operates on a reformulated version of the roll-on\textendash roll-off problem, i.e., a generalized vehicle routing problem with time windows. The algorithm\textemdash called wmpopt\textemdash is submitted to an extensive sensitivity analysis to determine its response to different parameter settings. After this, we test it on four real-life problem instances and compare its results to those obtained by a commercial solver. We show that wmpopt achieves much better solutions than the commercial solver in similar computing times.},

  abstract = {The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total recorded 5653 emptying events, 27\% were located outside Kampala city boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37\% were classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision accounted for 13\% of the total area. Service provision normalised by population density revealed much greater service provision in medium- and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.},
