  abstract = {Smart waste collection strategies have been developed to replace conventional fixed routes with dynamic systems that respond to the actual fill-level of waste bins. The variation in waste generation patterns, which is the main driver for the profit of smart systems, is exacerbated in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) due to a high expatriate ratio. This leads to significant changes in waste generation during breaks and seasonal occasions. The present study aimed to evaluate a geographic information system (GIS)-based smart collection system (SCS) compared to conventional practices in terms of time, pollution, and cost. Different scenarios were tested on a local residential district based on variable bin filling rates. The input data were obtained from a field survey on different types of households. A knowledge-based decision-making algorithm was developed to select the bins that require collection based on historical data. The simulation included a regular SCS scenario based on actual filling rates, as well as sub-scenarios to study the impact of reducing the waste generation rates. An operation cost reduction of 19\% was achieved with SCS compared to the conventional scenario. Moreover, SCS outperformed the conventional system by lowering carbon-dioxide emissions by between 5 and 22\% for various scenarios. The operation costs were non-linearly reduced with the incremental drops in waste generation. Furthermore, the smart system was validated using actual waste generation data of the study area, and it lowered collection trip times by 18 to 42\% compared to the conventional service. The present study proposes an integrated SCS architecture, and explores critical considerations of smart systems.},

  abstract = {Solid waste management systems receive wide attention from both economic and environmental planners because of its complexity and need coordination of various management strategies. Waste collection and transportation expenditures appear to play the most important roles in solid waste management, accounting for 50\textendash 80\% of the overall solid waste management budget. Integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) has been widely adopted in many cities around the world in order to improve waste collection and transportation. In this study, the GIS and GPS tools are used to maximize collection routing and minimize the overall cost of collection and transportation of solid waste in the city of Sheikh Saad in Wasit, Iraq. The actual solid waste collection and waste transportation in the state were evaluated as baseline. It found that the total current routes length of whole city 127.534 km and the total current collection duration of the routes take 1045 minutes to complete. Results from applying ArcGIS Network Analyst successfully suggesting 8.4\% reduction of routes travel distance with up to 15.5\% reduction of travel duration .The total length of the proposed routes was 117.685 km and the total time of the proposed routes was 905 minutes, a reduction of 9.849 km and 140 minutes. This reduction further benefits the fuel usage by 15\% saving the quantity of gasoline up to 260 liters per month, compared to the current practice. These total saving, if implemented, will improve human resources that equivalent to the salaries of one group of employees, who work on one vehicle: a driver, three employees, and a work supervisor. Based on the results, the application of GIS and GPS in solid waste collection optimization and waste disposal planning can improve overall solid waste operation, human resources and financial management.},

The computer models and methods are useful to bring out specific strategies for prevention and precaution of possible disasters that could be foreseen worldwide. This paper proposes a new Spatial Geographic Information System (GIS)-based Genetic Algorithm for optimizing the route of solid waste collection. The proposed algorithm, called SGA, uses a modified version of the original Dijkstra algorithm in GIS to generate optimal solutions for vehicles. Then, a pool of solutions, which are optimal routes of all vehicles, is encoded in Genetic Algorithm. It is iteratively evolved to a better one and finally to the optimal solution. Experiments on the case study at Sfax city in Tunisia are performed to validate the performance of the proposal. It has been shown that the proposed method has better performance than the practical route and the original Dijkstra method.},

An intensive literature search, key informant interviews (KIIs), in-depth interviews (IDIs) and on-site observation checklist were used for data collection. The KIIs were conducted with the Oyo State Waste Management Authority, Agodi, Ibadan and the heads of the scavengers at four dedicated dumpsites in Ibadan. In addition, IDIs were widely conducted with the residents and private waste collectors in both low- and high- density areas. There were 400 registered private refuse companies licensed by the government to complement the efforts of the state government and 244 street sweepers to sweep the city on daily basis. However, despite the efforts of both actors, substantial quantity of solid waste remained on the streets to be collected and transported to designated dumps. There was communication gap between the residents and waste management actors. This was a main factor undermining effective waste collection and transportation, thereby inhibiting litter-free environment in the city. Respondents believed that effective communication on solid waste management issues would provide a long lasting solution to waste management problems in the city. The paper recommended the integration and collaboration of all the stakeholders through broad-based sensitization and communication of effective and sustainable waste management in Ibadan. This should be conceptualized under Information, Education and Communication (IEC) strategies, integrated solid waste management approach and community participation. This holistic approach can be adapted for effective and sustainable waste management in any part of the country.},

It is a complex process that is expensive and requires the elaborate logistics management and in-depth mathematical computation. Hence, there is an urgent necessity to develop an efficient waste collection process while saving time, fuel, labour, maintenance costs, and carbon emissions. This goal of this is paper is to deliver a comprehensive review of the SWC system concerning solid waste collection objectives, constraints, the different optimization approaches, and models, along with their strengths and weakness. The different types of optimization objectives and constraints on SWC are highlighted towards improving solid waste collection and minimizing the cost. Furthermore, this review has classified the available optimization methods into different categories and technologies to provide a clear understanding for the readers. Besides, future research gaps are identified through the investigation of various key issues and challenges of the existing methods. Moreover, the significant contributions of SWC in connection to sustainable development goals (SDGs) are explained thoroughly. Finally, the review delivers some important proposals that would be beneficial to the researchers and policymakers to design an efficient and robust SWC system toward achieving SDGs.},

Here, we investigated waste disposal practices in relation to household/dwelling characteristics in South African low-income communities. Data for 2014 to 2019 from a community-orientated primary care program were analyzed using logistic regression. Families who reported living in a shack were more likely to dump waste in the street. Households who reported using non-electric sources of fuel for heating/cooking, those who lacked proper sanitation, and those who did not have access to piped water inside the dwelling were more likely to dispose of waste by dumping it in the street/in the yard or burying it. Families living in low-income settlements are at risk of solid waste exposure and this situation is exacerbated by poor access to piped water, proper sanitation, and electricity.},

  abstract = {Solid waste management (SWM) is a global issue and has proven to be a key challenge facing many developing countries. SWM constitutes a crucial health and environmental problem. Most cities spend 20-50\% of their annual budget on solid waste management, but only 20-80\% of the waste is collected. Due to the diversity of different system components that need to be addressed and the inability of a single tool to assess all components, it has necessitated the need for an integrative approach to SWM issues. Recently more integrative techniques and methods are being utilized to address the different issues that arise in solid waste management as a whole. One technique or method is inefficient and cannot encompass all components of a solid waste management system. This paper looks into the different system analysis techniques that have been applied in SWM and shows system engineering tools have a wide and diverse application, require less data, and are quite cost effective when compared to the system assessment tool, which requires a wide and diverse range of data to be applicable and reliable. The system engineering tools when applied do not reflect the actual scenario for assessment and are quite difficult to implement practically. The system engineering tools are very reliable with regard to choosing options and stimulation of a scenario. System assessment tool seem more realistic, practically applicable for the decision makers and analysis/assessment using system assessment tools can easily be understood and simplified. An integration of engineering and system assessment tools seems more appropriate for obtaining a holistic assessment.},

  abstract = {`Waste' is everywhere, a common aspect of daily life in both the West and the Global South. However, the ways in which we as individuals understand it as a problem is far from universal. It does not exist independently from the people it affects, rather, waste, as a problem, is continually made and remade through human practice. The purpose of this article is to explore how and why certain `waste' items are and become understood as problems. We adopt Foucault's (1984) notion of `problematisa-tion', as an analytical lens for conceptualising processes of problem formation through the eyes of two different groups working within and on the margins of Mzedi Dump Site in Blantyre, Malawi: subsistence maize growers and informal waste pickers. Drawing on extensive qualitative and ethnographic fieldwork, our findings suggests that for those working at Mzedi, waste problematisations are shaped by the tangible: the visible, and often painful impacts that Mzedi's hazards have on their lives and livelihoods. However, the ultimate problematisation of waste lies in its utility, i.e. `good' waste, is internalised based on its value. `Bad' trash however, is problematised because it has no value, and is therefore considered useless, a problem taking up time and space that could be utilised more profit-ably. Understanding these processes of problem formation, and the degree to which waste problematisations are personal and/or socially constructed, has important ramifications for the adoption of appropriate waste management strategies and should inform a more nuanced and inclusive waste management studies discourse.},

Recently, Informal Waste Pickers (IWPs) have been incorporated into waste management cooperatives by formalizing their operations as a strategy to improve the quality and efficiency of waste management in such areas. This study was conducted in Zingwangwa, an unplanned settlement in Blantyre, Malawi, to understand whether the formalization of IWPs into cooperatives could be effective and/or accepted as a way of managing Municipal Solid Waste in unplanned urban settlements in Malawi. Thirty-four IWPs in Zingwangwa were identified and interviewed using a structured questionnaire; personnel from the Blantyre City Council and middlemen were interviewed as key informants. We determined that IWPs experience challenges in all dimensions of their lives: low material prices with exploitative price fluctuations, negative public perception and a lack of transportation are a few of their struggles. Furthermore, a fear of decreased income, conflicts during proceeds sharing, free riding behaviors and an attachment to their independence mean that IWPs are unlikely to form a cooperative on their own though some would be willing to join if a third party initiated the formalization process.},

The system is composed of three tier structure such as lower, middle and upper tier. The lower tier contains bin with sensor node installed in it to measure and transmit bin status to the next tier, the middle tier contains the gateway that stores and transmits bin data to control station and control station resides in the upper tier that stores and analyze the data for further using. An energy efficient sensing algorithm is also used in the first tier to collect the bin parameters.

  abstract = {Background: Approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn) have been previously used to quantify the regularity in centre of pressure (COP) time-series in different experimental groups and/or conditions. ApEn and SampEn are very sensitive to their input parameters: m (subseries length), r (tolerance) and N (data length). Yet, the effects of changing those parameters have been scarcely investigated in the analysis of COP time-series. This study aimed to investigate the effects of changing parameters m, r and N on ApEn and SampEn values in COP timeseries, as well as the ability of these entropy measures to discriminate between groups. Methods: A public dataset of COP time-series was used. ApEn and SampEn were calculated for m = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, r = \{0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5\} and N = \{600, 1200\} (30 and 60 s, respectively). Subjects were stratified in young adults (age {$<$} 60, n = 85), and older adults (age {$\geq$} 60) with (n = 18) and without (n = 56) falls in the last year. The effects of changing parameters m, r and N on ApEn and SampEn were investigated with a three-way ANOVA. The ability of ApEn and SampEn to discriminate between groups was investigated with a mixed ANOVA (within-subject factors: m, r and N; between-subject factor: group). Specific combinations of m, r and N producing significant differences between groups were identified using the Tukey's honest significant difference procedure. Results: A significant three-way interaction between m, r and N confirmed the sensitivity of ApEn and SampEn to the input parameters. SampEn showed a higher consistency and ability to discriminate between groups than ApEn. Significant differences between groups were mostly observed in longer (N = 1200) COP time-series in the anterior-posterior direction. Those differences were observed for specific combinations of m and r, highlighting the importance of an adequate selection of input parameters. Conclusions: Future studies should favour SampEn over ApEn and longer time-series ({$\geq$} 60 s) over shorter ones (e.g. 30 s). The use of parameter combinations such as SampEn (m = \{4, 5\}, r = \{0.25, 0.3, 0.35\}) is recommended.},

Energy and nutrients could be recovered; however, with many biowaste options available, choosing what technology to implement is difficult. Selecting Organic Waste Treatment Technology (SOWATT) is a tool that supports decision making for selecting a biowaste treatment option considering social, technical, and environmental aspects. SOWATT was used to evaluate options for Blantyre's Limbe Market. Anaerobic digestion, black soldier fly processing, slow pyrolysis, in-vessel composting, windrow composting, vermicomposting, and wet-biomass-briquetting were considered as options. The performance of each alternative was assessed based on five objectives by government, NGO, and market-based stakeholders in order to determine the most acceptable option for the greatest number of people: something that is rarely done, or if it is the preferences are not rigorously quantified (e.g., stakeholder workshops) and/or weighted against specific objectives. However, given the novelty of the ranking-solicitation process, some participants struggled with the variety of options presented, and further iterations of SOWATT will address this limitation. Ultimately, vermicomposting scored highest of all alternatives and could best achieve the five objectives as prioritized by the stakeholders when implemented.},

Especially considering the high proportion of organic waste, composting is a promising opportunity to tackle the problem. However, composting has had low uptake due to competing fertilizer subsidies, the perceived labour required, and a lack of training and equipment. Considering these issues, this paper presents an analysis of the political dynamics around SWM at markets in Blantyre, Malawi, and to understand how these dynamics may potentially affect the sorting of organic waste in order to improve the production of compost. We find complex systems of both formal and informal management that are deeply linked to the official political structures, creating a diverse array of actors with various vested interests. Implementing a separation program would need community engagement and long-term financial viability to ensure that the project is not abandoned as others have been. This paper contributes to understanding how the complexity of urban governance, combined with party politics, can affect the potential for introducing new models of waste management. It emphasises the importance of understanding both informal and formal management structures before designing interventions.},

We estimated the willingness to pay (WTP) for two hypothetical solid waste collection services. Additionally, we tested the impact of the WTP question positioning relative to environmental perceptions on respondents' WTP. The first scenario involved a five minute walk to a disposal facility; the second scenario involved a 30 min walk. Additionally, the order of the question was randomized within the questionnaire. A WTP value of K1780 was found for the five minute walk scenario when the question was placed first, and K2138 when placed after revealing the respondent's perceptions on the environment. In the 30 min walk scenario, WTP was K945 when placed first and K1139 when placed after revealing the respondent's perceptions on the environment. The estimated values indicate that there is both a willingness to pay for solid waste services and that there are at least two options that would be acceptable to the community; a pilot scale implementation would be required to validate the hypothetical values, especially given the dependency on problem framing. Community financing should be considered as a sustainable approach to solid waste management in underserved areas.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop an intelligent solution to a complex, real-life vehicle routing problem in the waste management sector. Waste management companies deliver various types of empty waste containers to industrial customers, to be filled with different types of waste, after which the containers are picked up again. The full containers are transported to a so-called waste management depot or waste handling depot, where they are emptied, after which they are reused. Empty containers are stocked in various stock depots. Time windows in which containers may be picked up and delivered at the customers and opening hours of the different depots have to be taken into account additionally. Very importantly, there are two types of waste collection trucks that can, respectively, carry one or two containers. The resulting vehicle routing problem belongs to a class of so-called roll-on\textendash roll-off problems, characterized by unit demand. Additionally, the problem discussed in this paper has several characteristics (multiple waste types, multiple container types, multiple depots, a heterogeneous fleet, pickup and delivery, time window constraints, and other) that make solving it a difficult task. To solve this problem, we develop a novel column generation scheme that incorporates a heuristic approach to generate new columns. The master problem is solved by linear relaxation of a set partitioning problem. New routes (columns) are generated by a constructive heuristic loosely based on Solomon's insertion heuristic for the vehicle routing problem with time windows. The construction heuristic operates on a reformulated version of the roll-on\textendash roll-off problem, i.e., a generalized vehicle routing problem with time windows. The algorithm\textemdash called wmpopt\textemdash is submitted to an extensive sensitivity analysis to determine its response to different parameter settings. After this, we test it on four real-life problem instances and compare its results to those obtained by a commercial solver. We show that wmpopt achieves much better solutions than the commercial solver in similar computing times.},

Uncertain MDPs (UMDPs) capture this model ambiguity by defining sets which the parameters belong to.

In this work, we focus on planning for Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) UMDPs with uncertain cost and transition functions. We introduce a Bellman equation to compute the regret for a policy. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm that utilises the regret Bellman equation, and show that it optimises minimax regret exactly for UMDPs with independent uncertainties. For coupled uncertainties, we extend our approach to use options to enable a trade off between computation and solution quality. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world domains, showing that it significantly outperforms existing baselines.},

The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total recorded 5653 emptying events, 27\% were located outside Kampala city boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37\% were classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision accounted for 13\% of the total area. Service provision normalised by population density revealed much greater service provision in medium- and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the effect of applying optimization methods on the collection process of solid waste, with particular interest in mathematical programming and geographic information system approaches in developing countries. Mathematical programming approaches maximize or minimize an objective function for improvement in procedure, to ensure operational efficiency and also serve as decision support tools. They however provide partial solutions when implemented in reality and cannot fully handle road network constraints. Geographic information system approaches allow processing of additional considerations, often ignored in other methods, such as the street network modeling. Incorporating environmental pollution consideration is very challenging in this approach, the vehicle routing problem solver encountering limits for large data. For enhanced efficiency of the vehicle routing systems, studies should further focus on incorporating all network constraints, environmental pollution considerations, and impact of land use changes on routing.},

  abstract = {Environmental considerations and corresponding legislation cause a shift from waste management to materials management, requiring efficient collection of these flows. This paper develops a model for building tactical waste collection schemes in which a set of capacitated vehicles visits a set of customers during a given time period. Each vehicle must visit the disposal facility to discharge the waste after each customer visit. This is motivated by the fact that the waste of each customer has to be weighed at the disposal facility. The goal is to find a set of routes for each vehicle that satisfy both the demand and the frequency constraints and minimize the total cost. Since a state-of-the-art solver could not find a solution with a reasonable gap within an acceptable time limit, a column generation and a mixed integer programming-based heuristic are proposed. While the mixed integer programming-based heuristic outperforms the column generation heuristic in terms of solution quality, the lower bound provided by column generation allows to prove the small optimality gaps of the solutions obtained. Moreover, by applying both heuristics on instances derived from real-life data, they proved to be capable of finding good quality solutions in small computation times.},

  abstract = {Population growth associated with population migration to urban areas and industrial development have led to a consumption relation that results in environmental, social, and economic problems. With respect to the environment, a critical concern is the lack of control and the inadequate management of the solid waste generated in urban centers. Among the challenges are proper waste-collection management, treatment, and disposal, with an emphasis on sustainable management. This paper presents a systematic review on scientific publications concerning decision support systems applied to Solid Waste Management (SWM) using ICTs and OR in the period of 2010\textendash 2013. A statistical analysis of the eightyseven most relevant publications is presented, encompassing the ICTs and OR methods adopted in SWM, the processes of solid-waste management where they were adopted, and which countries are investigating solutions for the management of solid waste. A detailed discussion on how the ICTs and OR methods have been combined in the solutions was also presented. The analysis and discussion provided aims to help researchers and managers to gather insights on technologies/methods suitable the SWM challenges they have at hand, and on gaps that can be explored regarding technologies/methods that could be useful as well as the processes in SWM that currently do not benefit from using ICTs and OR methods.},

  abstract = {This paper uses the lens of `integrated sustainable waste management' to examine how cities in developing countries have been tackling their solid waste problems. The history of related concepts and terms is reviewed, and ISWM is clearly differentiated from integrated waste management, used mostly in the context of technological integration in developed countries. Instead, integrated sustainable waste management examines both the physical components (collection, disposal and recycling) and the governance aspects (inclusivity of users and service providers; financial sustainability; coherent, sound institutions underpinned by proactive policies). The data show that performance has improved significantly over the last 10 years. Levels of collection coverage and controlled disposal of 95\% in middle-income and 50\% in low-income cities are already commonplace. Recycling rates of 20\textendash 30\% are achieved by the informal sector in many lower income countries, at no direct cost to the city \textendash{} presenting a major opportunity for all key stakeholders if the persistent challenges can be resolved. The evidence suggests that efficient, effective and affordable systems are tailored to local needs and conditions, developed with direct involvement of service beneficiaries. Despite the remaining challenges, evidence of recent improvements suggests that sustainable solid waste and resources management is feasible for developing countries.},

  abstract = {According to most experts, integrated and sustainable solid waste management should not only be given top priority, but must go beyond technical aspects to include various key elements of sustainability to ensure success of any solid waste project. Aside from project sustainable impacts, the overall enabling environment is the key feature determining performance and success of an integrated and affordable solid waste system. This paper describes a project-specific approach to assess typical success or failure factors. A questionnaire-based assessment method covers issues of: (i) social mobilisation and acceptance (social element), (ii) stakeholder, legal and institutional arrangements comprising roles, responsibilities and management functions (institutional element); (iii) financial and operational requirements, as well as cost recovery mechanisms (economic element). The Gianyar Waste Recovery Project in Bali, Indonesia was analysed using this integrated assessment method. The results clearly identified chief characteristics, key factors to consider when planning country wide replication but also major barriers and obstacles which must be overcome to ensure project sustainability. The Gianyar project consists of a composting unit processing 60 tons of municipal waste per day from 500,000 inhabitants, including manual waste segregation and subsequent composting of the biodegradable organic fraction.},
