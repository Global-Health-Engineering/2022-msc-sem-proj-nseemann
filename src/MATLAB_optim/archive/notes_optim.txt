1-week optimization

- intra weekly scenarios simply accounted for
- extra weekly scenarios coupled with a factor affecting filling rate
	- or extra weekly scenarios not binary but in set 1/n for 1<n<4, with n in int
	- xit (and others) int and >= scen <-- probably not

Increase gap --> no big difference

Input current levels and changes in constraints
Input reporting from dump (or truck) + monitoring --> improve filling rates
 
Improve filling rates data during operations --> no need for monitoring period

Base on current operation trends (median gap)

Monitoring strategy (calls, observers, dump arrivals)

Current tasks:
- limit excess original assignment of schedules 
- more scens
- results presentation
- for skips with a limited number of scens, give alternative scenarios with additionals skips
        (simply divide filling rates homogeneously)



%% needed output
decision variables: xit, xit_adj, xit_extra, fit, fit_adj, fit_extra, yis, yis_extra, numV_D
resulting: add_bins_vect, distance_diff
preprocessing: scen_cells,scens,C_rates, compost_ind, depot_ind, dump_ind,filling_rates,
scen_cells_extra,scen_cells_indices, skip_nums_extra_scens, dist_mat, indices_facilities, 
indices_skips, t_mat

Sometimes chooses lower to add skip because higher skip is feasible,
but lower adds more flexibility, especially with time constraints.
